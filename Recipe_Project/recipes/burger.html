        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.</p>
        <p>Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p><br>
